# URL Attack
This is a simple JS game, utilizing the address bar of your browser. It was inspired by the awesome work of http://glench.com/hash and (somewhat) "Spacewar!". Feel free to fork and modify!

## Demo
An online demo can be found and played here:
* http://urlattack.huangart.at

How to play:
* Press space to start the game.
* Enemies are coming in from the right and try to destroy your base.
* Once an enemy reaches the base it causes damage and dies.
* You got three barriers for defense
* Once your cannon is ready (indicated by X) you can fire bullets by pressing "s".
* Try to keep the enemies on distance to protect your base.
* The density of spawning enemies is increasing while your score rises.
* The game is over once your canon gets git by an enemy.
